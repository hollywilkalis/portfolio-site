      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I coded my first website using Microsoft Notepad, Netscape Navigator (remember that one?), and a copy of HTML for Dummies. It included frames, and probably some "under construction" graphics from time to time. Those were the days.</p>

      <p>But I've improved since then, and these days I'm enjoying my deep dive into the mysterious world of frameworks, package managers, and missing semi-colons.</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, photography, gardening, writing ridiculous social media posts, volunteering, and being outdoors. I like to hike and kayak, and I love being at the beach. I'm also a cymbalist with the Last Regiment of Syncopated Drummers and the volunteer coordinator for the Portland Old Time Music Gathering.</p>

      <p>Have a web application that you need help with? Just want to chat about code? I'd love to talk with you - get in touch!</p>
