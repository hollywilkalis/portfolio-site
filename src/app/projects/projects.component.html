          <p class="card-text">For my Epicodus capstone project, I chose to work on a photo library interface for a previous employer to enable them to share their new custom stock photos with staff around the state. This is still a work in progress. The finished product will include a separate page with photo details, user login, and an improved admin console.</p>

          <p class="card-text">This was an Epicodus team week project. It started out as an online mood tracker but we realized we'd been too ambitious given the available time and so it was scaled it back to a sleep tracker. This was my first time being the project repository manager and I learned a lot about effectively managing pull requests.</p>

          <p class="card-text">I had the chance to spend about eight months working with my agencys web team to migrate the site to a new version of Sharepoint with responsive layouts. We faced a lot of challenges, including outdated content, thousands of broken links and orphaned documents, and the need to accommodate a wide variety of editor skill levels. But I'm proud of the work I did to create a site that is more usable for both staff and the public.</p>
